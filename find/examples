get directories and set permissions to 0445 under /var/www

find /var/www/ -type d -print0 | xargs -0 -I {} chmod 0445 {}

Finding files and printing their full name

You wish to find out all *.c (all c source code) files located under /home directory, enter:
$ find /home -name "*.c"

You would like to find httpd.conf file location:
$ find / -name httpd.conf
Finding all files owned by a user

Find out all files owned by user vivek:
# find / -user vivek

Find out all *.sh owned by user vivek:
# find / -user vivek -name "*.sh"
Finding files according to date and time

Files not accessed in a time period – It is useful to find out files that have or have not been accessed within a specified number of days. Following command prints all files not accessed in the last 7 days:
# find /home -atime +7

    -atime +7: All files that were last accessed more than 7 days ago
    -atime 7: All files that were last accessed exactly 7 days ago
    -atime -7: All files that were last accessed less than7 days ago

Finding files modified within a specified time – Display list of all files in /home directory that were not last modified less than then days ago.
# find /home -mtime -7
Finding newer (more recently) modified files

Use -newer option to find out if file was modified more recently than given file.
# find /etc/apache-perl -newer /etc/apache-perl/httpd.conf
Finding the most recent version of file

It is common practice before modifying the file is copied to somewhere in system. For example whenever I modify web server httpd.conf file I first make backup. Now I don't remember whether I had modified the /backup.conf/httpd.conf or /etc/apache-perl/httpd.conf. You can use the find command as follows (tip you can also use ls -l command):
find / -name httpd.conf -newer /etc/apache-perl/httpd.conf
Locate command

The locate command is often the simplest and quickest way to find the locations of files and directories on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.

For example, the following command uses the star wildcard to display all files on the system that have the .c filename extension:
# locate "*.c"


# search for JayZ with remix mp3 only
find . –name “*.mp3” | grep –i JayZ | grep –vi “remix”
