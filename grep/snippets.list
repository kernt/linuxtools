 grep -Ev '^(#|$)' /Path/to/file # Print lines without "#" to your Termianl.
 
#Display Number of Lines Before or After Search String
#
#Another couple of options are the –A and –B switches, 
#which displays the matched line and number of lines either that come before or after the search string. 
#While the man page gives a more detailed explanation, I find it easiest to remember the options as –A = after, 
#and –B = befo
#
ifconfig | grep –A 4 eth0
#
ifconfig | grep  -B 2 UP


#Prints Number of Lines Around Match

#The grep’s –C option is similar, but instead of printing the lines that come either before or after the string,
#it prints the lines in either direction:

ifconfig | grep –C 2 lo


#Count Number of Matches

#Similar to piping a grep string to word count (wc program) grep’s built-in option can perform the same for you:
# ifconfig | grep –c inet6

#Search Files by Given String
#The –n option for grep is very useful when debugging files during compile errors. It displays the line number in the file of the given search string:

grep –n “main” setup..py

#Search a string Recursively in all Directories
#If you would like to search for a string in the current directory along with all of the subdirectories, you can specify the –r option to search recursively:

grep –r “function” *
