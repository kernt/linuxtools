#Executes commands based on the screensaver starting or ending

#Notes:
#boolean true = screensaver start
#boolean false = screensaver end

#Note an "&" may be needed after the commands
#to put the program in the background and release the shell,
#otherwise it may not work, eg: "transmission &"


# Note if you want to add multiple commands then just stack them after one an other like:
#system("my command &");
#system("my other command &");
#system("my last command &");

#Screensaver-torrent

#The Zenity-Kill-Torrents script presents a yes/no box when the screensaver deactivates to choose whether or not to keep transmission running
