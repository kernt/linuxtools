To change the password, I have made it very easy for you to do so. Just open what is called a terminal window, either by pressing the left <Windows> button on your keyboard OR by going to Menu (bottom left button) -> Accessories -> Terminal, AND then inside the terminal window, after '~ $ ', where it is flashing, type: "passwords" (without the parentheses), press <Enter> on your keyboard, and enter your own password. It is that easy.
