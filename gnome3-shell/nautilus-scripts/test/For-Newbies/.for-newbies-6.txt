Your home folder (similar to a 'My Documents' folder in Windows) is 'me', and can be opened either by going to Menu (bottom left button) -> Places -> Home Folder, OR double-clicking the left mouse button on 'me's Home' on the Desktop. The 'Temp' folder inside is what is set for all downloads and is my ideal for using as the working folder for whatever you want. In the 'Pictures' folder, there is a 'Backgrounds' folder that includes all of your desktop backgrounds and is where you can add or remove backgrounds. It is currently set to random choose a background/wallpaper image from that folder (as well as the main system one) every time you restart your computer. You can also random change the background whenever you want simply by single-clicking the right mouse button anywhere on the Desktop (or in Nautilus File Manager) -> Scripts -> My_Scripts -> Random-Wallpaper.py.
