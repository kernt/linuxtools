If you'd like to add/remove software, Ubuntu has a very easy way to do so. Just go to the Ubuntu Software Center, by going to Menu (bottom left button) -> Ubuntu Software Center. It lists all the software found in the repositories currently available on this computer (which are all of the official Ubuntu ones as well as many Launchpad PPAs (repositories from people and software-makers to provide more up-to-date versions than what may be found in the official Ubuntu ones) and other repositories featuring software not found elsewhere.
