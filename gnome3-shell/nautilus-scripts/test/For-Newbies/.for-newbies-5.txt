Ubuntu updates and upgrades are currently set up to install automatically, either by installing important security updates (and prompting you for any others) while your computer is up and running, or by installing anything and everything at every restart through another popup box automatically. Very easy. For the former, you will need your password. One thing about updates on Ubuntu is it updates everything, both the operating system and the installed applications through the repositories (official and unofficial servers that house a large number of various applications and games).
