Ubuntu is an operating system, just like Windows (ie. XP, Vista, 7). It is a Linux distro, meaning it uses the Linux kernel, which is essentially the brains of the operating system. (Windows uses its own kernel). Ubuntu is highly customizable, and I have tweaked it to look similar to Windows, but it can look, feel, and run any way you'd like. Unlike Windows, Ubuntu is free, as well as nearly all of its applications. Less than 1% of the world uses Linux; about half of that use Ubuntu (#1 ranked Linux distro). And due to this, and the fact that its structure is different than Windows, it is pretty much virus-free. Also, no Windows viruses can ever harm a Linux/Ubuntu computer. So download away.
