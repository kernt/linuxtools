## SCRIPT: 00_xTerminal_multiCmd_here.sh
##
## PURPOSE: This script opens an xterm with the command prompt 'positioned'
##          in the directory you select ---
##          and executes a user-specified 'string' of commands.
##          A zenity prompt asks for the command(s), with examples shown.
##
##          xterm is run with the '-hold' parameter, to see error messages
##          if the command fails with a syntax error or whatever.
##
##          Since the '-e' option of xterm accepts only one command (with
##          optional parameters), this script uses a separate, hidden (Nautilus)
##          script, '.eval-cmds4term.sh', to pass the command string to xterm
##          for execution.
##
## HOW TO USE: Right-click on any file (or directory) in a Nautilus
##             directory list.
##             Under 'Scripts', choose this script to run (name above).
