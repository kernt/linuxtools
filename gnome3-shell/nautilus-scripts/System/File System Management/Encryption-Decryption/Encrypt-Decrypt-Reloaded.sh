#	*NOTE* - This is alpha-grade software!!!  Although reasonable
#             measures have been taken to verify proper functionality
#	      of this script, there is NO guarantee that it doesn't
#	      contain any bugs!  Test it out first on a test file or
#	      directory to make sure it works the way you want it to!

######
#
#  This  encrypter/decrypter  script  must be  called from  Nautilus.
#  Place this script in your  nautilus-scripts directory and make sure
#  it's executable  (chmod 775 this_script.sh)  and it will show up in
#  the,  "Scripts" menu when files are right-clicked  from within your
#  Nautilus file  manager.  Please report any bugs to rob@pectol.com.
#
#  This script requires GnuPG for the file encryption/decryption.  It
#  is usually installed by  default on most  distributions.  However,
#  you may need to generate a key pair for your user account.  This is
#  easily accomplished by opening a shell and typing the following at
#  the command prompt:  "gpg --gen-key"  (Do *NOT* use sudo for this)
#  Once you have generated your keypair, you can start encrypting and
#  decrypting files with your key, using this script!  It's important
#  to NOT forget your passphrase or your encrypted files will be that
#  way forever!!!  This script  also requires  the wipe  command line
#  utility to handle  secure file  deletion.  If you  don't have  the
#  wipe  utility, you  can easily install  it by opening a  shell and
#  typing,  "sudo apt-get install wipe"  at the  command  prompt.

#  USER OPTIONS  #
##################

#  Secure File Deletion
#  This option allows you to have the script securely delete
#  the original file from the disk once it's been successfully
#  encrypted.  Selecting, "no" here will leave the un-encrypted
#  version in place and intact so BE WARNED!  This feature uses
#  the wipe command line utility to destroy the original file
#  once it's been successfully encrypted.  Once the original
#  file has been wiped, it is gone!  The only recovery possible,
#  for that file, is to decrypt it's encrypted version.  Don't
#  forget your GnuPG passphrase!!!  Set this option to, "yes"
#  to activate this feature.
rm_cleartext_file="yes"

#  Cypher-text File Deletion
#  This option allows you to have the script delete the
#  encrypted file once it's been successfully decrypted.
#  Set this option to, "yes" to activate this feature.
rm_cyphertext_file="yes"

#  Encrypting files to self.  This option allows you to encrypt
#  files to yourself as the anonymous or hidden recipient.  That
#  way you can encrypt files to someone else's public key, while
#  still allowing you the ability to decrypt them with your key.
#  Be careful as setting this to, "no" and enabling secure file
#  deletion will render your file inaccessible to you if you
#  choose to encrypt it with someone else's public key.  It's
#  probably a good idea to leave this set to, "yes" for most
#  instances.
encrypt_to_self="yes"

#  This option enables verbose feedback during script
#  execution.  With it disabled, only critical errors
#  and the final end results are displayed with minimal
#  verbosity.
verbose="yes"
