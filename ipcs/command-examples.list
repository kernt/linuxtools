#Different Types of IPCS


#There are various IPC’s which allows a process to communicate with another processes, either in the same computer or different computer in the same network.
#
#    Pipes – Provides a way for processes to communicate with each another by exchanging messages. Named pipes provide a way for processes running on different computer systems to communicate over the network.
#    Shared Memory – Processes can exchange values in the shared memory. One process will create a portion of memory which other process can access.
#    Message Queue – It is a structured and ordered list of memory segments where processes store or retrieve data.
#    Semaphores – Provides a synchronizing mechanism for processes that are accessing the same resource. No data is passed with a semaphore; it simply coordinates access to shared resources.
